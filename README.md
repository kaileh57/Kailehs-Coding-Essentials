# Kailehs Coding Essentials
My inspiration to make this was to learn the process of creating a macropad to move on to a more complex project, such as a keyboard. I've also wanted one of those StackOverflow copy paste keyboards FOREVER, but have never really had a chance to get one. The macropad will likely end up with a variety of configs based on the app, and should make it easier to perform common tasks as I do more development!!
